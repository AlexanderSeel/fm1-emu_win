After copying, run this once in Terminal:

    xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/FM-1.component ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/FM-1.vst3 ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/FM-1.clap'

FM-1 plugin $version: the M-VAVE FM-1 emulator as an instrument (AU, VST3, CLAP)
https://github.com/joakimeriksson/fm1-emu

For Macs with Apple silicon (M1 or later), macOS 11 or later.

1. Copy the plug-ins to your plug-in folders (create the folders that are missing):
     FM-1.component  ->  ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/   (AU: Logic, GarageBand)
     FM-1.vst3       ->  ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/         (Ableton, Cubase, Reaper, ...)
     FM-1.clap       ->  ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/         (Bitwig, Reaper, ...)
   In Finder: Go > Go to Folder... and paste ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins
2. $unblock
3. Restart your DAW. Add "FM-1" (by fm1-emu) as an instrument on a track.
   GarageBand: tick Settings > Audio/MIDI > Enable Audio Units first.
4. In the plug-in's window, click "Load firmware..." and pick a .fwsc package: a community
   firmware (the list, with each author's link: https://joakimeriksson.github.io/fm1-emu/)
   or M-VAVE's own. Play it from MIDI or with the mouse on its panel.

The firmware and the patches it saves are kept in your project.

The M-VAVE FM-1 emulator as an **instrument plugin**: **AU** (Logic, GarageBand), **VST3**
(Ableton Live, Cubase, FL Studio, Reaper, Bitwig, Studio One…) and **CLAP**.

- **Load firmware…** loads any \`.fwsc\`: the community firmwares
  ([the list](https://joakimeriksson.github.io/fm1-emu/)) or M-VAVE's own. An SMK-37 package
  gets the SMK-37's panel.
- MIDI from the DAW plays it; the panel plays with the mouse. *Master* can be automated, and
  *MIDI channel* moves notes to one channel (M-VAVE's firmware listens on 2).
- The project keeps the firmware and the patches it saves.
- The emulator's lead over the DAW is reported as latency, so notes land where they were placed.

**Download:** \`$name.zip\`, for Macs with Apple silicon (macOS 11 or later). Its \`INSTALL.txt\`
says where each file goes.$( [ -n "$notarized" ] && echo " Signed and notarized." || printf '\n\nThis build is **not signed** with an Apple Developer ID, so macOS blocks it until it is\nallowed. After copying the plug-ins, run once in Terminal:\n\n```sh\nxattr -dr com.apple.quarantine ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/FM-1.component ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/FM-1.vst3 ~/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/CLAP/FM-1.clap\n```' )

It passes Apple's AU validator and Steinberg's VST3 validator. It has been tried in GarageBand
and Steinberg's VST3 test host. Problems with other DAWs:
[issues](https://github.com/joakimeriksson/fm1-emu/issues).

MIT licensed, like everything it builds with (nih-plug, clap-wrapper, the CLAP, AudioUnit and
VST3 SDKs). The firmwares are their authors'.
